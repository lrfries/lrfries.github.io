        <p> The rise in internet usage is one of the world’s largest global adaptations. With over 5 billion people currently using the internet across the world, it has become a central outlet for communication, business, education and entertainment, transforming the way regions, countries, social and economic groups, function collectively, and individually on a daily basis. However, despite its collective global prominence, and overall growth since it was adapted, the internet isn’t as easily acceptable and widely used across some areas as opposed to others. </p>
    

        <h2>The beginning of internet usage</h2>

        
        <p>Although 1983 is widely considered as the “birthday of the internet,” the origins of it date back closer to the 1960s. During this time the U.S Department of Defense funded the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the first operational packet-switching network that delivered a message from one computer located at the University of California Los Angeles to another at Stanford. In 1983, ARPANET officially changed to the TCP/IP standard, allowing computers to communicate with one another on a single universal network.</p>

        <h3> Why didn’t internet usage start to rise until 1990?</h3>
        <p>Even though the modern internet was adopted in 1983, internet usage didn’t begin to increase until the 1990s. This is because in 1990, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, allowing individuals to share information via websites using hypertext (HTTP) and hypertext markup language (HTML) allowing the internet to be accessed on a broader scale. </p>

    <h2>Areas with the most internet usage in 1990</h2>
    <h5> United States - 0.78%</h5>
    <p class="body-text"> In relation to the invention of the Internet, it is no surprise that the United States had the most internet usage in the 1990s. Factors such as being the birthplace of the internet, infrastructure, big domestic market, and strong industries made it easy for the internet to be implemented early on. </p>

    <h5> Norway - 0.71%</h5>
    <p class="body-text"> Being the first country outside of the United States to connect to ARPANET, Norway displayed the second largest average of individuals using the internet in 1990. Associate communications professor and Director of the Center For Global Engagement Brad Gorham shared that Norway has a Sovereign wealth fund that is fueled by petro-dollars, giving them public money to spend. </p>  

    <p class="body-text">He noted that Scandinavian countries early on saw the internet as a potential, not just an information tool. They take their education very seriously and invest in it, combining their public wealth fund with their strong public support for education. </p>

    <h5> Switzerland - 0.6% </h5>
    <p class="body-text"> Although the infrastructure of the internet was developed in the United States, the World Wide Web, the software of the internet, was created at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which is located in Switzerland. </p> 
    
    <p class="body-text"> In 1987, Switzerland developed SWITCH, a national network operator for Swiss universities and research institutions that is responsible for connecting them to the global internet. Because of this and CERN, Switzerland had a strong internet base early on among universities and research institutions.</p>
