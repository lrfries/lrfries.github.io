        <p> The rise in internet usage is one of the world’s largest global adaptations. With over 5 billion people currently using the internet across the world, it has become a central outlet for communication, business, education and entertainment, transforming the way regions, countries, social and economic groups, function collectively, and individually on a daily basis. However, despite its collective global prominence, and overall growth since it was adapted, the internet isn’t as easily acceptable and widely used across some areas as opposed to others. </p>
    
        <hr style="border: 1px solid #333; margin: 20px 0;">

        <h2>The beginning of internet usage</h2>

        
        <p>Although 1983 is widely considered as the “birthday of the internet,” the origins of it date back closer to the 1960s. During this time the U.S Department of Defense funded the creation of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the first operational packet-switching network that delivered a message from one computer located at the University of California Los Angeles to another at Stanford. In 1983, ARPANET officially changed to the TCP/IP standard, allowing computers to communicate with one another on a single universal network.</p>

        <h3> Why didn’t internet usage start to rise until 1990?</h3>
        <p>Even though the modern internet was adopted in 1983, internet usage didn’t begin to increase until the 1990s. This is because in 1990, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, allowing individuals to share information via websites using hypertext (HTTP) and hypertext markup language (HTML) allowing the internet to be accessed on a broader scale. </p>

    <h2>Areas with the most internet usage in 1990</h2>
    <h5> United States - 0.78%</h5>
    <p class="body-text"> In relation to the invention of the Internet, it is no surprise that the United States had the most internet usage in the 1990s. Factors such as being the birthplace of the internet, infrastructure, big domestic market, and strong industries made it easy for the internet to be implemented early on. </p>

    <h5> Norway - 0.71%</h5>
    <p class="body-text"> Being the first country outside of the United States to connect to ARPANET, Norway displayed the second largest average of individuals using the internet in 1990. Associate communications professor and Director of the Center For Global Engagement Brad Gorham shared that Norway has a Sovereign wealth fund that is fueled by petro-dollars, giving them public money to spend. </p>  

    <p class="body-text">He noted that Scandinavian countries early on saw the internet as a potential, not just an information tool. They take their education very seriously and invest in it, combining their public wealth fund with their strong public support for education. </p>

    <h5> Switzerland - 0.6% </h5>
    <p class="body-text"> Although the infrastructure of the internet was developed in the United States, the World Wide Web, the software of the internet, was created at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which is located in Switzerland. </p> 
    
    <p class="body-text"> In 1987, Switzerland developed SWITCH, a national network operator for Swiss universities and research institutions that is responsible for connecting them to the global internet. Because of this and CERN, Switzerland had a strong internet base early on among universities and research institutions.</p>

          <h2> Areas with the most internet usage in 2020</h2>
          <p>With 2020 being a large year for internet usage due to the COVID-19 global pandemic driving many activities to be pushed on line, internet usage across many areas was significantly high. </p>

          <h5> United Arab Emirates - 100%</h5>
            <p class="body-text"> Being one of the wealthiest countries per capita, the majority of the population has access and can afford smartphones, computers, and broadband connections. With a population of 9.83 million and 18.38 mobile connections the United Arab Emirates will have 9.73 million active internet and social media users in 2020. </p>  

            <h5> Bahrain - 99.671%</h5>
            <p class="body-text"> In 2020 Bahrain achieved Nationwide 5G services, becoming one of the first countries in the world, with 5G download speeds exceeding 2Gbps. With a small population of around 1.6 million , Bahrain is one of the wealthiest countries in the middle east, allowing internet acess to be widely available to the population. </p>

        <h3> Areas with the least internet usage in 2010</h3>
        <p>Despite the percentage of internet usage across areas increasing significantly as time passes, there are still many areas around the world that are unable to provide widespread access across their population, resulting in a digital divide across the globe. By 2010, when the internet had been accessible for around 20 years, areas such as Norway and Iceland were thriving in the digital world, with average usages of over 90%. On the contrary, areas such as Somalia and Burundi had averaged less than 2%, as well as African countries such as Chad and Niger, and many others.</p>

        <p>Professor Brad Gorham shared that there are multiple factors that can play into a low percentage of internet usage, “For some of these countries it's related to money, if the private sector in these countries is not as robust, if the public funding is not there, then you're not going to see the internet spread as much.”</p>

        <p>As far as countries that show a high percentage of data usage, Gorham stated, “Quite frankly, Norway, Scandinavia, they're not just wealthy in terms of what the businesses and what the governments have to spend. They're GDPs are pretty high, right? And so their populations are relatively well off,” said Gorham.</p>

        <p>“You would expect to see that digital divide to be a lot more pronounced in poor countries where the people who are going to have access to the Internet and where the Internet infrastructure is probably going to be centered around major metropolitan areas.”</p>

      <h3>The role of media in internet usage</h3>
      <p class="media-text">To understand the divide in certain areas around the world, it's important to understand what drives the adoption of new technologies.</p>

      <p class="media-text">“There are always some super early adopters and folks who adopt new technologies very early on. But things don't really pick up until a critical mass of people see that this new technology is meeting their needs better than the existing technologies that they have been using,” said Gorham, “ so partly you can look at the adoption of the internet and how it picked up by how well did the technology start to meet people's various needs.”</p>

      <p class="media-text">Media in many forms has become more prevalent especially in recent years, with it being widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as many forms of entertainment, work, and communication were cut off, but also in general as it grows and develops to fit the needs of society.</p>

    <div class="row">

    <p class="media-text">“Media helps us connect with other people that give us things to talk about. We share community with people around shared fandoms, for instance, or, you, watching the same films and being able to talk about them or picking up when people use media illusions,” said Gorham, “We use media for mood management. So as the technologies of the internet improve to the point where you could, for instance, stream music you could see why people would adopt these technologies that allow them to enjoy their music anywhere more easily and more effectively than the existing technology.”</p>

  <h2>Key Take Aways</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Despite the internet being accessible for over 30 years, the digital divide still persists, with many areas still remaining almost entirely offline. </li>

    <li>There are many factors that play into internet accessibility that drives internet usage. These can include wealth, population, GDP, and public spending. </li>

    <li>There is a geographical advantage to internet adoption starting from when the internet was first invented and available for public use. Areas that were closer in vicinity to the adoption, and organizations that played roles in the creation of the internet, were able to access and utilize the internet faster and more widely across their population. </li>

    <li>The internet is an ever-growing concept and will adapt to fit the needs of the public. This has been a trend early on and will continue to be in the future. In the beginning, it was used solely for governmental and military purposes. As it became available to the public, it adapted to fit the needs of populations, causing the adoption of new internet outlets like media and boosting its prominence overall. </li>
